Automated Tool for Hierarchical Exploration of Neural Architectures

</p>


## Description
**Athena**, named after the Greek goddess of wisdom and strategy, is an intuitive web-based tool designed to streamline the creation of machine learning models by generating starter code and meaningful visualizations. Whether you're a beginner looking for a quick way to structure your ML projects or an experienced practitioner prototyping architectures, **Athena** simplifies the process by providing ready-to-use code snippets and clear model diagrams.

## Features
- üîÄ Model Types
  - Support for Fully Connected (FCN) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Model Architecture
  - Add, remove, rearrange layers
  - Edit layer parameters such as type, size, and other applicable parameters such as kernel and stride
- ‚úÖ Validation
  - Layer arrangement and all layer parameters are validated upon generation.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Generation
  - Single click generation of starter code and architecture visualization
- üñºÔ∏è Interactive Visualization
  - Interactive visualization with ability to expand into full screen, zoom and pan along with rotate for CNNs
  - Clean and minimal architecture visualizations with configurable annotations settings
- üìãüíæ Copy and Save
  - Copy your code or download as a python file
  - Download the model visualization as an image   

## Usage
- Choose the type of your model - FCN or CNN
- Add and configure layers and their parameters
- Move, delete and rearrange layers to achieve your desired model architecture
- Generate code and visualization with one click
